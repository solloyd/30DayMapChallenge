# 30DayMapChallenge 2024 :world_map:

This is a collection of my #30daymapchallenge for 2024! For more information on the challenge, please visit: https://30daymapchallenge.com 

New year, new chance to learn new skills and techniques! You can expect to see more data from the MidWest and lots of outdoor themes - land use, recreational trails, etc🌲🍂

| Software      | Count*        | Days          |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |

###### *Not everyday required making a map in these softwares (i.e., Day Ten: Pen & Paper), which is why the total will be less than 30

## Day One

📍 Points

*Cue Smokey* ONLY YOU CAN PREVENT WILDFIRES! But seriously, Michiganders, campfires being far and away the largest wildfire burn area in 2023 is something WE have the power to decrease. Let's recreate responsibly and make sure any fires lit are extinguished and never left alone.

## Day Two

〰️ Lines

I couldn't pass up an opportunity to mention that I ran my first marathon this year😂🏃‍♀️ On top of covering 26.2+ miles in one go, I completed a trail marathon, which means it was all covered on hiking trails. This map depicts the exact course that I covered and I've highlighted two insets that show the contrast this course had - at times we were marched straight up a "hill" and other times it was flowy trails in a more open field.

## Day Three

🔲 Polygons

If you've ever been to Michigan and attempted to define where "Up North" starts, you've probably heard the farmland reasoning. This claims that when the bulk of the farmland in the lower peninsula falls away as you drive north, then you are officially "Up North". So it would make sense that forests and farmlands make up the largest land use classes.

## Day Four

💠 Hexagons

Great Lake State? Great *Park* State! One of the biggest factors that has kept be in Michigan following my graduate studies at U of Michigan, is the ever abundant opportunities to enjoy beautiful public spaces! In Michigan you are never more than an hour from a Great Lake, and based on this map, you're even closer to a park (or ten!).

BONUS: (Mainly so I do not forget next time I try this technique) Building a hexagon grid and then binning it yourself is super simple in QGIS with the 'mmqgis' plug in. First you can make the grid through this plug in, clip it to a layer (ie the outline of Michigan), and thne use Vector>Points in Polygons to count and add a new layer to your project.
