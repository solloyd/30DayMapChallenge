# 30DayMapChallenge 2024 :world_map:

This is a collection of my #30daymapchallenge for 2024! For more information on the challenge, please visit: https://30daymapchallenge.com 

This year I am starting from scratch, and develing into my personal interests versus professional ones (as I did in 2022). You can expect to see more data from the MidWest and lots of outdoor themes - land use, recreational trails, etc.

| Software      | Count*        | Days          |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| R             |  0            |     |
| QGIS          |  1            |  1           |
| ArcPro        | 0             |              |

###### *Not everyday required making a map in these softwares (i.e., Day Ten: Pen & Paper), which is why the total will be less than 30

## Day One

📍 Points

*Cue Smokey* ONLY YOU CAN PREVENT WILDFIRES! But seriously, Michiganders, campfires being far and away the largest wildfire burn area in 2023 is something WE have the power to decrease. Let's recreate responsibly and make sure any fires lit are extinguished and never left alone.
