# 30DayMapChallenge 2024 :world_map:

This is a collection of my #30daymapchallenge for 2024! For more information on the challenge, please visit: https://30daymapchallenge.com 

This year I am starting from scratch, and develing into my personal interests versus professional ones (as I did in 2022). You can expect to see more data from the MidWest and lots of outdoor themes - land use, recreational trails, etc.

| Software      | Count*        | Days          |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| R             |  0            |     |
| QGIS          |  1            |  1           |
| ArcPro        | 0             |              |

###### *Not everyday required making a map in these softwares (i.e., Day Seventeen: A map without a computer), which is why the total will be less than 30
