# 30DayMapChallenge 2022

This is a collection of my #30daymapchallenge for 2022! For more information on the challenge, please visit: https://30daymapchallenge.com

I chose the theme **energy** as a central thread to this challenge to help me refamiliarize myself with data sources I haven't worked with recently, as well as a way to find new datasets.
