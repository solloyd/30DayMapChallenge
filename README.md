# 30DayMapChallenge 2022 :world_map:

This is a collection of my #30daymapchallenge for 2022! For more information on the challenge, please visit: https://30daymapchallenge.com 

I chose the theme :low_brightness:**energy**:low_brightness: as a central thread to this challenge! This is not a requirement, I could make completely different maps each day, but would like to explore new energy datasets, and ones I haven't had an opportunity to work with recently. Additionally, I'm setting out to use this challenge as a way to strengthen my R mapping skills, and completely learn QGIS, as basically all of my formal education was taught using ArcMap and then ArcPro from ESRI.

## Day One

üìç Points. 

Looking at the power stations in Zambia in terms of type and amount of capacity!

I set out to use this 30 Day Challenge to refamiliarize myself with mapping in R, and potentially also learn QGIS. Today I realized this is going to be a lot harder than I originally thought... In ArcPro I could've produced a basic map like this in under a half hour, but in R let's say it took me muuuuuuch longer.

## Day Two

„Ä∞Ô∏è Lines. 

I am reusing a map I made while working in the [FUEL Lab](fuel.seas.umich.edu) because this is such a cool concept (S/O Cheryl Weyant for trusting me with the execution!). This depicts the electricity lines in Zimbabwe over nighttime lights imagery, so you can see where energy is being used and how that corresponds to the grid!

## Day Three

üî≤ Polygons.

The US uses a lot of energy... that is no surprise to anyone, but how much are Americans using in each state? The top five states based on consumption per capita are (in million BTU): Louisiana (903), Alaska (874), Wyoming (874), North Dakota (804), and Iowa (479). I used a diverging color palette for this map to show the wide range of values - you can see the top three states clearly in the green, followed by a handful of light yellow states, and many light and dark orange states. This is the importance of colors scales... (hint for a future day)

## Day Four

üíö Color Friday: Green

To many, EVs are seen as the future of the car industry, but how much momentum is the EV industry having as compared to "traditional" vehicles? In 2020, EV sales made up 4% of all vehicle sales. IEA's [Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS)](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-energy-and-climate-model/stated-policies-scenario-steps), which is described as "a more conservative benchmark for the future", shows that EV sales share for cars by 2025 is 15%, and by 2030 this increases to only 22%ü•≤

In the US, where [over 90% of adults commute to work in a personal vehicle](https://www.bts.gov/archive/publications/highlights_of_the_2001_national_household_travel_survey/section_01), by 2030 we are just below the world average at 21% od EV sales share for cars.

According to a [2021 article by McKinsey & Co](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/leaving-the-niche-seven-steps-for-a-successful-go-to-market-model-for-electric-vehicles), the biggest challenges facing manufacturers are:
- Regulatory Environment
- Customers
- EV Infrastructure
- EV Business Case and Profitability

## Day Five

üá∫üá¶ Ukraine

I was going to make a bubble map, similar to what I did on Day One, showing the size of city's populations and color them based on whether or not they are under Russian occupation, but there is already a great map out there doing that: [Russo-Ukranian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Russo-Ukrainian_War_detailed_map)

Instead I repurposed the data, and looked at population of Oblasts in relation to power plant locations. I'm having a lot of fun exploring the cartographic possibilities of QGIS!

## Day Six

üåê Network

For Sunday, Day Six, I decided to step outside of the conventional data box I have been in and try something more fun - the networks of travel modes I'll be utilizing for my trip to üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†ÅøScotlandüè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åø in April! My main agenda item is to hike the 96 mile [West Highland Way](https://www.westhighlandway.org) and bag the highest peak in the UK, Ben Nevis, which should only take 8 out of the 14 days I will be in the country, so I'll then bus over to Iverness to see the Loch Ness (MonsterüëÄ) and take the train around the east coast to see castles in Aberdeen and beaches in Dundeeüòç before flying back out of Edinburgh‚úàÔ∏è

## Day Seven

üñºÔ∏è Raster

Raster Data is my least favorite type of data to work with, so I had not felt inspired and made other maps first.. plus I ran my first Spartan Race yesterday and have no energy to make the map today for Day Seven. **So instead, please enjoy this meme from Alicia :)**

## Day Eight

üìñ Data: OpenStreetMap

According to the IEA, in 2019 the Republic of Korea (*also referred to as South Korea*) is the leading country for [Passenger transport energy intensity](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-tools/clean-energy-transition-indicators) at 1.98 MJ/pkm (energy consumption / passenger-kilometers).

These data were pulled from Open Street Map via [GeoFabrik](https://www.geofabrik.de/data/download.html) and analyzed in **QGIS**

## Day Nine

ü™ê Space

I was inspired by a map put together by John Nelson @ESRI (you can find his [tutorial here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijVEvzTzlNo&t=2s)), which is intended as an 80s war room map, but it reminded me of the video game üëæ*Space Invaders*üëæ I figured out how to replicate this map in QGIS, with flight data from [The OpenSky Network](https://zenodo.org/record/7065179#.Y2BGjS1h3UI) on the same day one year ago.

I couldn't decide which version, so here is both:

<details><summary>Click Here for a helpful QGIS tip!</summary>
<p>
When attempting to map a line from two points in the same CSV file... Google is a worm hole of adjacent answers that will not help you in a timely manner. You will then find the answer, use it, and rejoice, only to be even more disappointed when you need it for a future project and cannot find it.
        
This is both my solution to you, fictional person's, problem and my own future self's. Below you will find the one line of code to quickly and easily map one line based on two points in one CSV file. I am sorry I cannot credit the person who gave me this solution because, due to the aforementioned worm hole, I cannot find it again.

```ruby
# Used in QGIS 3.22.11
# First map point "1", then go to Properties > Symbology > Simple Marker and change this to "Geometry Generator" then enter the following code:
make_line( make_point( "longitude_1","latitude_1"),make_point( "longitude_2","latitude_2"))      
```
