# 30DayMapChallenge 2022 :world_map:

This is a collection of my #30daymapchallenge for 2022! For more information on the challenge, please visit: https://30daymapchallenge.com

I chose the theme :low_brightness:**energy**:low_brightness: as a central thread to this challenge! This is not a requirement, I could make completely different maps each day, but would like to explore new energy datasets, and ones I haven't had an opportunity to work with recently. Additionally, I'm setting out to use this challenge as a way to strengthen my R mapping skills, and completely learn QGIS, as basically all of my formal education was taught using ArcMap and then ArcPro from ESRI.

| Software      | Count         | Days          |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| R             |  1             | 1              |
| QGIS          |               |               |
| ArcGIS Online |               |               |
| ArcPro        |               |               |

## Day One

📍 Points. 

Looking at the power stations in Zambia in terms of type and amount of capacity!

I set out to use this 30 Day Challenge to refamiliarize myself with mapping in R, and potentially also learn QGIS. Today I realized this is going to be a lot harder than I originally thought... In ArcPro I could've produced a basic map like this in under a half hour, but in R let's say it took me muuuuuuch longer.
